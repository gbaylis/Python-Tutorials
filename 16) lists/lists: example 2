I created some lists
the lists are parts of a question or statement
some examples of selecting items from different lists, to form sentences
'''

# make a list, words used in an introduction
# hello is string # 0, programming starts counting at 0
list_1 = [" hello ", ' bye ', ' welcome ', " "]

list_2 = [' my ', ' your ', ' their ', " they're ", ' to ']

# ways to address a person
list_3 = [ ' sir ', " ma'am", ' *call them by name ']

list_4 = [' nice to meet you ' , ' thank you for coming ', ' how can I help you? ']

list_5 = [' I need help with ', ' where do I find']

list_6 = [ ' locating a place ', ' planning a trip ', ' a technical issue ']

list_7 = [ ' the airport ', ' the hospital ', ' the courthouse ', ' the mall ']

list_8 = [ '.', '?', '!', '&']

# if you want to print hello, take from 1_list
zero = list_1[0]
print(zero)
# output: hello
print("===== 2nd example \n")

# ask a woman you do not know, where do you find the airport
# ma'am is on list 3, it is item # 1
one = list_3[1]
# where to find is on list_5, item # 1 
two = list_5[1]
# the airport is on list_7
three = list_7[0]
# list 8, item # 1, for the ? 
four = list_8[1]
print(one, two, three, four)
#output ma'am where do I find the airport ?


print("===== 3rd example \n")
# ask someone you know to help you with a technical issue
# list 3, item # 2 is to call that person by their name
five = list_3[2]
# list 5, item # item # 0, to say you need help
six = list_5[0]
# list 6, item # 2 
seven = list_6[2]
# print, using the variables created 
print(five, six, seven)
# output *call them by name I need help with a technical issue

# 1st example
# create a list and then print a particular item from the list
coordinates = (4, 5, 12, 60, 357)
print(coordinates[3])  # prints 60, since it is item # 3 in the list

# 2nd example
# show that tuples are immutable, therefore cannot be changed
coordinates = (4, 5)
coordinates[1] = 10 # try to change the 5, into a 10
print(coordinates[1]) # then print item # 1 from the list, which hopefully has been changed to a 10
# Python would throw and error message, because once a tuple is set, it cannot be changed later

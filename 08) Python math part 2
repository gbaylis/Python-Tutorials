# part 1
# parentheses , performing math in a particular order
print(3 * (4 + 5)) # 4 + 5 = 9 * 3 = 27

# part 2
# absolute value, even if a number is negative, it still has a value
my_num = -5
print(abs(my_num)) # prints 5, because -5, still has a value of 5

# part 3
# pow, means to raise one number, by the power of another number
# print(pow(3, 3)) # 3 raised to the power 3 is = 27 ( or 3 times 3, times 3)

# part 4
# max, find and print the largest number in a list
print(max(4, 6, -1, 10, 44, 55)) # prints 55

# part 5
# min, find and print the smallest number in a list
print(min(4, 6, -1, 10, 44, 55)) # prints -1

# part 6
# round, to take a decimal and change it to the nearest whole number
print(round(3.2)) # prints 3, because 3.2 is closer to 3, then 4
print(round(5.9)) # prints 6, because 5.9 is closer to 6, then 5

# part 7
# numbers should be converted to a string, so they can be a part of a string
my_num = 5
print(str(my_num) + " was converted into a string")

# part 8
# floor rounds a decimal to the next lower whole number, in this case 3.7s floor is 3
from math import *
print(floor(3.7))

# part 9
# ceil as in ceiling, rounds a decimale to the next higher value whole number
from math import *
print(ceil(3.1)) # rounds to 4, since ceil would round this decimal up to 4

# part 10
#sqrt as in square root
from math import *
print(sqrt(36)) # prints 6
# the square root of 36, is 6

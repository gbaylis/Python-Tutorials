There are times, you will have different lists of items
and in those lists are duplicates
using union allows you to combine sets and will eliminate any duplicates when the information is printed
'''

bookCase_1 = {'Dune', 'A Scanner Darkly', 'iRobot'}

# a 2nd set, with its own variable name, but a duplicate Dune item
bookCase_2 = {'The Watchmen', 'Harry Potter', 'Hunger Games', 'Dune'} 
# union means to combine things, in this case, combine the 2 libraries

# union will combine the 2 sets and eliminate any duplicates
all_books = bookCase_1.union(bookCase_2)
print(all_books)

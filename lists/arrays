'''
Python

an array is a specific list, usually items that are related
'''

# part 1
# lists / arrays
fruit = ["apple", "pear", "orange"] # apple is the 0 element, pear is the 1 element and so on
print(fruit) # this would print the list

# part 2
fruit = ["apple", "pear", "orange"]
print(fruit[0]) # prints apple, it is item # 0 in the array

# part 3
fruit = ["apple", "pear", "orange"]
print(fruit[-1]) # prints orange, because -1 causes the program to count backwards
# if apple is 0, counting to -1 counts in reverse order, which lands on orange

# part 4
fruit = ["apple", "pear", "orange", "starberry", "blueberry", "melon"]
print(fruit[1:3])
# prints pear and orange, starts at position 1 which is pear, and stops at 2 (before 3)
# therefore, pear and orange are printed

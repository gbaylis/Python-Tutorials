Python | user input and strings
I created this example, to show how user input can be used in a creative situation
ask the user for input, then put those words into a story
'''

animal = input("Enter an animal.. ")
plant = input(" Enter a plant.. ")
color = input(" Enter a color.. ")
name = input(" Enter a name.. ")
color2 = input(" Enter a 2nd color.. ")

# the story, using the string the user entered
print( "There was a " + color + " " + animal + " named " + name)
print(name + " like to eat " + color2 + " " + plant)
print ("The " + color2 + " " + plant + " grew on the hillside")

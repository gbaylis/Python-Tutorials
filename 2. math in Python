# Python / types of numbers
# a Long is a large whole number
# an example of a Long
Long = 87473067304032
print(Long)

# part 2
# a float is a decimal number
float = 25.75
print(float)

# part 3
# a complex number has 2 parts
# it has a real number and the imaginary part with is followed by a j
# an example of a complex number is 3 + 8.13j

# part 4 
a = 2 # an int 
b = 2554784556784 # a Long
c = 12.05 # a float
d = 40 + 4j # a complex number

# add variable a to b and print the sum
print(a + b)

# if you subtract a integer from a float, the resulting number is still a float
print (c - a)

# if you divide a complex number by an int, the resulting number is a complex number
print(d / a)


# Integer Division, 16 divided by 5 and will give the remainder as a decimal
print(16 / 5)
 
 #   __3__
 # 5| 16
 #    15___
 #      1
 # 5 times 3 is 15, subtract 15 from 16 and you have a remainder of 1
 
 
# 16 divided by 5 gives a result of 3 and a remainder of 1 
# the % will give you the remainder after the division
print (16 % 5)

Casting is when you change something from one data type (string, int, boolean, etc), 
into another type of data (string, int, boolean, etc),
x is a string, even if it has a number in it
y is now a float, that is why it is displayed as a decimal
z is casted into an int, that is why it is displayed as a whole number
'''
x = str("xyz 5")
y = float(2)
z = int(3.0)
print(x) # is now a string
print(y) # 2.0
print(z) # 3

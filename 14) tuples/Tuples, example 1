 Tuples are immutable, you cannot add nor remove elements from it
 
 In this example, I will make a list of items
 then, I will make a 2nd list of items, with the same variable name
 notice that the 2nd list, over writes the first list
 You can over write with tuples, but can never add, or remove items
'''

# create 2 lists, but use the variable name "a"
a = (5, 6, 7) # create a list, '5' is item # 0 on the list
a = (9, 10, 11) # create a list, '9' is item # 0 on the list

print(a[0]) # print 9, because the 2nd list, over writes the 1st list

person = (" Mark ", 32, 'pick up truck') # create a list, with details describing a person

(name, age, vehicle) = person # give each item in the list, its own variable name

print(name) # would print Mark
print (age) # would print 32
print(vehicle) # would print pick up truck

print("...............Mark has updated his information")

# Mark is now age 40 and drives a car, over write the old information

age = 40

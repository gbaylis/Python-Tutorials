# 1st example
# create a list and then print a particular item from the list
coordinates = (4, 5, 12, 60, 357)
print(coordinates[3])  # prints 60, since it is item # 3 in the list

# 2nd example
# show that tuples are immutable, therefore cannot be changed
coordinates = (4, 5)
coordinates[1] = 10 # try to change the 5, into a 10
print(coordinates[1]) # then print item # 1 from the list, which hopefully has been changed to a 10
# Python would throw and error message, because once a tuple is set, it cannot be changed later

# 3rd example
# age, name, employed as a programmer
survey = (22, "Charles", True)

age = survey[0]
name = survey[1]
employed_programmer = survey[2]

print(" Age =", age)
print( " Name =", name)
print( " Employed as a programmer? ", employed_programmer)

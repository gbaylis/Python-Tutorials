# There is no easy way to make a multi line comment in Python, # in front of the next makes it a comment
# I used a online code compiler, to practice Python, a great tool for learning / practicing. 

# create 2 sentences and give the command to print them
# use the + "\n" to create a line break between the next 2 strings
print (' You can use single quotes ' + "\n")
print (" or use double quotes")


# part 2
# create a string variable and have it be equal to a sentence
myMessage = ' libraries have comfortable chairs.'
# now print that sentence, that is stored in that variable
print(myMessage)


# part 3
# use the \ symbol, when you use a single quote inside a sentence
myMessage2 = ' I\'m at the store to buy milk, eggs and bread.'
# now print the sentence stored in myMessage2
# use + "\n" to create a line break between myMessage2 & myMessage3
print(myMessage2 + "\n")


# part 4
# use double quotes "  " to get around the apostrophe problem, no need for the \
myMessage3 = "I'm looking for someone who can help move furniture."
# print myMessage3
print(myMessage3)

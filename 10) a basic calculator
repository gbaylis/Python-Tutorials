# I used floats, so the user can type decimals without the program crashing
# the + can be changed into subtraction - , multiplication * or division / 

# ask the user for a number
num1 = input("Enter a number, it can be a decimal: ")
# ask the user for another number
num2 = input("Enter another number, use a decimal if you like: ")
result = float(num1) + float(num2)

print(result) # print the answer to the math problem

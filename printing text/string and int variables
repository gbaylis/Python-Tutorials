how to print statements with string, ints and variables
'''
# use commas, when there is an int variable
x = 10
print(" I see " , x , " shoes")

# use plus signs, when its a string variable
x = "ten"
print("There are " + x + " birds")

# use str() so that the 6 can be treated as if it were a string
print("number " + str(6))

# use a plus sign, use commas for the 6
print("6" + "dollars")

# use a comma instead of the + sign
# and it creates a space between 6 and dollars
print("6","dollars")

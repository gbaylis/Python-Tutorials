String Variables
Gbaylis

I use a " " before the lines of text, because it creates a indent
When typing this example, change the variables, to a different name or age.

character_name = "John"
character_age = "35"
bar_name = "nite owl"

print(" There was a man named " + character_name)
print(" " + character_name + " owned a bar called " + bar_name )
print(" " + character_name + " was " + character_age + " years old")

# you can change an int or string variable half way through a program

character_name = "George"

print(" The bartender was named Ralph, but then change it to " + character_name)

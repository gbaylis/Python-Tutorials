# 1st example
phrase = " Lets Make This Sentence ALL Lower CASE"
print(phrase.lower()) # the above sentence will print, in only lower case letters

# 2nd example, make all letters in a sentence, upper case
# print a sentence in all upper case
phrase = " lets make this sentence all upper case"
print(phrase.upper())

# 3rd example, testing if all the letters in a sentence are upper case, if any character is not uppercase, the output is false
phrase = " lets make this sentence all upper case"
print(phrase.isupper())  

# 4th example, test if all the letters in the same sentence, are lower case, outputting either true or false
phrase = " lets make this sentence all upper case"
print(phrase.islower())         # would print true

# 5th example, convert a sentence into all upper case letters, then test if the sentence is in all upper case letters
# try testing this code, by converting the letters into lower case letters
phrase = " IS this Sentence ALL UPper CAse?"
print(phrase.upper().isupper())

# 6th example
# to find the character length of a string
phrase = " How many characters are in this string? "
print(len(phrase)) # would print 41 for 41 characters

# 7th example
# to print a particular character from a string
# D = 0, i = 1, d = 2, y = 4
phrase = "Did you know that in programming, counting starts at zero?"
print(phrase[0]) # would print D because that is the 0 or first character

# 8th example
# If you wanted to know the spot of a letter in a name, as in, l in letter is 0
# if you put e it would print 1, because the first e is in the 1 position
phrase = "letter"
print(phrase.index("t")) # prints 2, because the first t is character # 2

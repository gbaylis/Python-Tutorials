# a boolean test, on two variables that are not equal
a = 10
b = 20
# test if a is equal to b 
print(a == b) # would print false
# test if a is greater then b 
print(a > b) # would print false
# test if b is greater then a 
print( b > a)  # would print true
# test if a is not equal to b 
print(a != b) # would print true
# test if 5 + 6 is greater then or equal to 10
print(5 + 6 >= 10) # would print true
